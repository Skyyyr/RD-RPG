# RPG Styled game built with React/Django

The game is a 'click through the menus' type of game. The user will be presented with menus that allow them to interact with our game.
Instead of the user having a visual character to move around with keys (Ex. wasd) they will use the menus or potentially click on 'map locations'.

Character creation, Currency, Combat, Skills, Leveling, Items, Inventory, etc can all be built through the menus for the player to pick options from.

Ex.
Character Creation:
The user would receive a list of options to customize their character, ranging from name to looks, skills to professions.

# TODO list:
1. Create a demo page
   1. Clickable menus
      1. A menu has a title, details, and at least 1 option of choices
   2. Menus that lead to other menus
      1. "Go home" would lead to another option that would provide "Go to bed"
   3. Display area that reps the player's details
      1. The player's name (could just be given one without letting them pick)
      2. The player's health or energy or level - just display one additional stat
   4. Inventory display
      1. Display all the items the player has on them
         1. Bonus: Clickable inventory items
